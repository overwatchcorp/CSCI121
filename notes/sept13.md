## we had a quiz:
assignments done within functions are LOCAL, even if there is a variable with the same name in the global scope

## project 1
the die are from 0 to 5
once one player passes, the other player has only one more turn
to pass, roll 0 dice

strategies work like this
```python
    def strategy(myscore, theirscore, isLast):
        # data types
        # myscore int
        # theirscore int
        # isLast boolean
```

## also of note
```python
lambda param: param ** 2
```
